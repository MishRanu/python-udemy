#files must be written in the same order in which they were written
#there might be very few objects that cannot be wirrten by pickle
#there are some protocols: 5 of them for storing the data
#the original pickle protocol and python 3 pickle protocols are not backward compatiable
#python 2 introduced protocol 2, and python 3 uses protocol 3
#python 2 will not be able to unpickle data pickled by python 3

#pickling should not be used for unpickling data from internet and unsafe sources
#this could cause havoc in many cases
